The frill-necked lizard is so called because of the large ruff of skin which usually lies folded back against its head and neck. The neck frill is supported by long spines of cartilage which are connected to the jaw bones. When the lizard is frightened, it gapes its mouth, exposing a bright pink or yellow lining; the frill flares out as well, displaying bright orange and red scales. This reaction is often used to discourage predators or during courtship. The lizard is a member of the agamid family. It a relatively large lizard, growing up to 91.4 cm. The lizard is also capable of bipedal locomotion, that is they run on their hind legs only.","","","","","","","","","","","","2012-03-28T12:17:02Z","12:17:02+10:30","88","88","2012","3","28","2012-03-28 12:17:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Australia","AU","Northern Territory","","","","Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia","","","","","","","","","","","-12.387889","130.845703","EPSG:4326","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","49180451","","","Owen Gale","2019-04-05T13:12:49Z","","research","","31215","","","","","","","https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/2daefbe2-48bd-4637-a1d3-2d6080a37632","Chlamydosaurus kingii","Chlamydosaurus kingii","","","","","","","","Animalia","Chordata","Reptilia","Squamata","Agamidae","Chlamydosaurus","","","","species","","Gray, 1825","Frilled Lizard","","","","","","","","","Chlamydosaurus kingii","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0f397397-8993-4e38-bacf-6e6c97173601","","","","","","","","","","",""
